# Noise Maker

Makes noise based SVG patterns/textures

Built with jQuery and Bootstrap. In hindsight I wish I had started this project with Angular as the complexity grew more than I expected. Perhaps I will rewrite it one day.

- dragging a handle will scroll sliders into view
- Settings as shareable links with query string params
- Different backgrounds (solid, gradient, images)
- Different shapes as container elements
