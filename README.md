# Noise Maker

Makes noise based SVG patterns/textures

https://finitelooper.github.io/noise-maker/

Built with jQuery and Bootstrap. In hindsight I wish I had started this project with Angular as the complexity grew more than I expected. Perhaps I will rewrite it one day.

## Development

- Install `sass` globally by running `npm i sass -g`
- Run `npm run watch:ts` and `npm run watch:sass` in separate processes to compile TypeScript and SCSS as files are changed
- Run `npm run build` to generate a prod-ready minified version of the app

## TODO Items

- Settings as shareable links with query string params
