# Noise Maker

Makes noise based SVG patterns/textures

Built with jQuery and Bootstrap. In hindsight I wish I had started this project with Angular as the complexity grew more than I expected. Perhaps I will rewrite it one day.

TODO:

- Add "handles" in the UI for modifying X/Y light positions
- Different shapes as container elements
- Settings as shareable links with query string params
- Rewrite in Angular?
