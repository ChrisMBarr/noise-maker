# Noise Maker

Makes noise based SVG patterns/textures

You can generate Perlin Noise, add lighting effects, add 2D filter effects, and change the background behind it all.
Once you have something you like you can copy the code it generates to use this on your own web project, or copy a URL to share.

Built with jQuery and Bootstrap. In hindsight I wish I had started this project with Angular as the complexity grew more than I expected. Perhaps I will rewrite it one day.

## Development

- Install `sass` globally by running `npm i sass -g`
- Run `npm run watch:ts` and `npm run watch:sass` in separate processes to compile TypeScript and SCSS as files are changed
- Run `npm run build` to generate a prod-ready minified version of the app
